# Eventella

This paper is an exploration of the Eventella event management platform, with a focus
on its system architecture and key components. The API Gateway within the microservices
architecture is given special attention, with a detailed analysis of its capabilities and practical
implementation of key functionalities such as authentication, request rate limiting, traffic
routing, and information logging, using the FastAPI framework. The paper also provides an
overview of popular cloud and on-premise solutions.
Integration with the Keycloak service is extensively described, with a focus on
fundamental concepts, functionalities, and the utilization of the OpenID Connect protocol.
Basic components of the Keycloak service are presented, and various integration methods
with usage examples are discussed.
The paper also presents the implementation and demonstration of service
functionalities in the background, explaining the role of each service to comprehend their
contribution to the system. Through the analysis of these components, the paper provides
insight into the technologies employed and current practices for building a secure and scalable
event management system.
